Over a million tickets have been sold ahead of its July 4 release, raking in more than $10 million in pre-sales, per Deadline.</p>

<p>The PG-13 film is based on the true story of Tim Ballard (played by Jim Caviezel), a former Homeland Security agent who, after discovering that the sister of the boy he rescued from being sex trafficked is still being held captive, sets out to save hundreds of other children from captivity.</p>
<p>According to IMDb, Ballard asked for Caviezel to play him in the film, despite going against the initial wishes of the producers. Prior to starring in what is being described as a “faith-based thriller,” Caviezel also starred in The Passion of the Christ.</p>
<p>The film is based on the true story of Tim Ballard, a former U.S. government agent that quits his job to rescue children from global sex traffickers. Ballard (Caviezel), a federal agent, finds himself losing hope in the dark field of children crime work. However, Ballard quickly uncovers his life mission when he’s able to free a seven-year-old boy that was kidnapped. When the young boy asks Ballard to find his sister who was also kidnapped, Ballard decides to devote his life to rescuing children from sex slavery.</p>
<p>Sound of Freedom” releases across the U.S. on July 4. The film is scheduled for a Disney+ release on 2023-07-04, 2023. Angel Studios is set up as a platform empowering filmmakers with full creative control to crowdfund, create and distribute films and TV series globally. The studios’ first projects – “The Chosen” and “Dry Bar Comedy” – have earned billions of views around the world.</p>
<p>How to watch? There are a few ways to watch Sound of Freedom that will be available to watch online on Netflix very soon!

Yes we have found an authentic streaming option / service. Details on how you can watch Sound of Freedom 2023 for free throughout the year are described below.</p>
<p>Is Sound of Freedom available to stream? Is watching Sound of Freedom on Crunchyroll, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Netflix or Amazon Prime? Yes we have found an authentic streaming option.</p>
<p><strong>When Will the Movie Sound of Freedom be Released?</strong></p>
<p>The release date was announced at Angel Studios’ annual Illuminate event on May 11. Sound of Freedom will be in theaters on July 4, 2023.</p>
<p><strong>When Will Sound of Freedom Be Streaming?</strong><br />
The film is being released exclusively in theaters to “north of 2,600 locations” on Tuesday, July 4. If you want to catch the faith-based thriller any time soon, you have to head to your local movie theater to do so. Due to the theatrical release, there has yet to be a streaming release date announced.</p>
<p>However, we can look to a previous Angel Studios release for clues about a potential streaming release window. His Only Son was released in theaters on March 31, 2023, and hit digital release about two months later, on June 25. If Sound of Freedom follows the same pattern, you can expect it to premiere on VOD platforms like iTunes, Prime Video and Angel.com in either late October or early November of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>How to watch Sound of Freedom for free</strong><br />
A silver lining to Sound of Freedom being delayed a bit longer, more chance for new moviegoers to experience the original Sound of Freedom for themselves — or for fans of the movie to watch it for the eighth hundred time, no judgement. At this time, Sound of Freedom is available to stream with a Netflix subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Where to Watch Sound of Freedom Online?</strong><br />
There are currently no platforms that have the rights to Watch Sound of Freedom Online. MAPPA has decided to air the movie only in theaters because it has been a huge success. The studio, on the other hand, does not wish to divert revenue. Streaming the movie would only slash the profits, not increase them.</p>
<p><strong>Watch Now: <a href="https://daily-entertainment-24.blogspot.com/2023/07/movie.html">Sound of Freedom 2023 Online</a></strong></p>
<p>As a result, no streaming services are authorized to offer Sound of Freedom for free. The film would, however, very definitely be acquired by services like Funimation, Netflix, and Crunchyroll. As a last consideration, which of these outlets will likely distribute the film worldwide?</p>
<p><strong>Is Sound of Freedom on Netflix?</strong><br />
The streaming giant has a massive catalog of television shows and movies, but it does not include ‘Sound of Freedom.’ We recommend our readers watch other dark fantasy films like ‘The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf.’</p>
<p><strong>Is Sound of Freedom on Amazon Prime?</strong><br />
Amazon Prime’s current catalog does not include ‘Sound of Freedom.’ However, the film may eventually release on the platform as video-on-demand in the coming months. Therefore, people must regularly look for dark fantasy movies on Amazon Prime’s official website. Viewers who are looking for something similar can watch the original show ‘Dororo.’</p>
<p>There are a few ways to watch Sound of Freedom online in the U.S. You can use a streaming service such as Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video. You can also rent or buy the movie on iTunes or Google Play. You can also watch it on-demand or on a streaming app available on your TV or streaming device if you have cable.</p>
<p><strong>Is Sound of Freedom available on HBO Max?</strong><br />
HBO Max is a relatively new streaming service that offers Sound of Freedom for viewing. You can watch Sound of Freedom on HBO Max if you’re already a member. If you aren’t already a member, you can sign up for a one-month free trial and then cancel it before the month is up if you don’t want to keep the subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Is Sound of Freedom Available On Disney Plus?</strong><br />
Sound of Freedom is a movie that may be streamed on Disney Plus. You can watch Sound of Freedom on Disney Plus if you’re already a member. If you don’t want to subscribe after trying out the service for a month, you can cancel before the month ends. On other streaming services, Sound of Freedom may be rented or purchased.</p>
<p><strong>What is Sound of Freedom About?</strong><br />
In ‘Sound of Freedom’ Jim Caviezel is an ex-agent on the hunt for missing children. It’s the first crime thriller for Angel Studios, which made its reputation with biblical stories. Star Jim Caviezel, who plays real-life anti-trafficking activist Tim Ballard, has been talking about adrenochrome and organ harvesting on his press tour. And really, how distant can Ballard (and by extension his organization) be from QAnon when the guy who’s playing him, with whom he’s been promoting Sound of Freedom, has been using the press opportunity to peddle QAnon theories about adrenochrome and organ harvesting?</p>
