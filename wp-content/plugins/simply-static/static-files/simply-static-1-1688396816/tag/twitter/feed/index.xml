<p>Social networking site Twitter has set a temporary limit on the number of tweets users can read in a day. Elon Musk, the owner of this social media, announced this last Sunday.</p>



<p>Elon Musk announced on Twitter that a maximum of 600 posts per day can be read from accounts that are not verified. 300 posts can be read from new accounts that are not verified.</p>



<p>But in case of verified account, the number of daily post reading will be 6 thousand. Elon Musk says data theft has &#8216;reached extremes&#8217;. To combat this, user posts are temporarily limited.</p>



<p>Last Friday, many users were asked to log in to view tweets. Musk said the conditions were imposed on users as an immediate emergency measure.</p>



<p>Arguing in favor of limiting users&#8217; tweets, Elon Musk said that Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;stacks&#8221; of data are reducing the quality of service for ordinary users.</p>



<p>Elon Musk bought Twitter for 4 thousand 4 billion US dollars last year after many struggles. After becoming the owner, he announced layoffs. In one blow, the employees of the company were reduced from 8 thousand to 1500.</p>



<p>He had to face a lot of criticism for this. Elon Musk then canceled the opportunity to become a verified user (blue ticked account) on Twitter for free. Now in exchange for money user account has blue tick.</p>
